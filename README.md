Electric propulsion is a method of propelling spacecraft using electrical energy to accelerate propellant. Unlike traditional chemical propulsion, electric propulsion systems use electrical power to ionize and accelerate gas (typically xenon) to generate thrust. While the thrust produced by electric propulsion is much weaker than chemical rockets, it is far more efficient in terms of fuel consumption, making it ideal for long-duration missions where high efficiency is essential.

There are several types of electric propulsion systems, including:

1. **Ion Thrusters**: These use electricity to ionize a propellant (usually xenon) and accelerate the ions through an electric field, generating thrust. NASA's Deep Space 1 and Dawn spacecraft used ion thrusters.

2. **Hall Effect Thrusters**: These ionize a propellant and accelerate it using both electric and magnetic fields. They're more efficient than ion thrusters and are widely used for station-keeping and satellite propulsion.

3. **Electrospray Thrusters**: Use electrostatic force to accelerate liquid ions directly. These are primarily used in smaller satellite applications.

4. **Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (PPT)**: Generate plasma through pulsed discharges and expel it at high speed to generate thrust. They are simple and compact but have lower efficiency compared to other types.

5. **Magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) Thrusters**: Utilize a strong magnetic field to accelerate plasma. MPD thrusters can generate more thrust compared to ion or Hall thrusters but require significant electrical power.

Electric propulsion is primarily suited for deep-space exploration, satellite station-keeping, and orbital adjustments due to its high fuel efficiency over long periods, though it's not effective for launch from Earth's surface due to its low thrust.
